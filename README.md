## Student Proyect by Franco Vega


## Whats "Simple! Asteroids" ?

Simple! Asteroids is the sequel to the first game of the Simple! series.The Simple! Games series consists of remakes of classic games to practice videogame programming and learn from the different processes that takes place in videogame development.

This sequel,as you may have guessed, is a remake of the classic game "Asteroids". To make it more pleasant to the naked eye, I have added new visuals,sounds and even interactive menus!

## Ok,but what exactly is Simple! Asteroids?

Its a classic game of Asteroids, but it includes some changes and new features that are standard on these days. I plan to release these features:

- Interactive Menu with animated background.
- Different settings such as resolutions and volume modification.  [WIP]
- Instead of moving the player with traditional arrows keys, the controls scheme is now 90% based on the mouse.
- Improved visuals.
- New sounds and songs! [WIP]
- Different Levels.  [WIP]


## Release

Once the game is finished, it will be available for everyone on both https://frankvega.itch.io/ and https://gamejolt.com/@frankvega/games.

I will try to patch any bugs after the release to try to keep the game nice and clean.
