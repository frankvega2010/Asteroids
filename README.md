## Whats "Simple! Asteroids" ?

Simple! Asteroids is the sequel to the first game of the Simple! series.The Simple! Games series consists of remakes of classic games to practice videogame programming and learn from the different processes that takes place in videogame development.

This sequel,as you may have guessed, is a remake of the classic game "Asteroids". To make it more pleasant to the naked eye, I have added new visuals,sounds and even interactive menus!

Its a classic game of Asteroids, but it includes some changes and new features that are standard on these days. The game has these features:

- New visuals.
- New sounds and songs!
- TWO new Powerups!
  1. Invincibility Powerup: Makes you invincible to any asteroids for 5 seconds.
